# Rook Ceph Continued...

There are more moving parts to Ceph that you'll probably want to set up, but
aren't strictly needed. I'll document those here.


## Snapshot Classes

For some backup utilities, or even for manual backup, you'll probably want to
be able to create point-in-time snapshots of your PVCs with COW (copy-on-write)
semantics. This is something that Ceph natively supports using the hidden (even
from `ls -al`) directories called `.snap` that exist in every directory in the
filesystem. However, it takes a bit more setup to do this "the Kubernetes way".

The following YAML file will create a `VolumeSnapshotClass` that will tell
Kubernetes how to take these point-in-time snapshots:

```yaml
# kubectl apply -f <file>
---
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: rook-fs-snap
driver: rook-ceph.cephfs.csi.ceph.com
parameters:
  clusterID: rook-ceph # name of the CephCluster resource
  csi.storage.k8s.io/snapshotter-secret-name: rook-csi-cephfs-provisioner
  csi.storage.k8s.io/snapshotter-secret-namespace: rook-ceph
deletionPolicy: Delete
```

## Block Storage

If you plan on running virtual machines, have specific filesystem requirements,
etc, you'll likely want to set up block storage. The following yaml will set up
a Ceph RBD pool backed by nvme storage:

```yaml
# kubectl apply -f <file>
---
apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephBlockPool
metadata:
  name: vm-storage-nvme
  namespace: rook-ceph
spec:
  failureDomain: host
  replicated:
    size: 3
    requireSafeReplicaSize: true
  deviceClass: nvme
```

This one will set up a block-based storage class to consume the
`CephBlockPool`:

```yaml
# kubectl apply -f <file>
---
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
   name: vm-storage-nvme
provisioner: rook-ceph.rbd.csi.ceph.com
parameters:
    # clusterID is the namespace where the rook cluster is running
    clusterID: rook-ceph
    # Ceph pool into which the RBD image shall be created
    pool: vm-storage-nvme

    # RBD image format. Defaults to "2".
    imageFormat: "2"

    # For 5.4 or later kernels:
    imageFeatures: layering,fast-diff,object-map,deep-flatten,exclusive-lock

    # The secrets contain Ceph admin credentials.
    csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-name: rook-csi-rbd-provisioner
    csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: rook-ceph
    csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-name: rook-csi-rbd-provisioner
    csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-namespace: rook-ceph
    csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-name: rook-csi-rbd-node
    csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-namespace: rook-ceph

    # Specify the filesystem type of the volume. If not specified, csi-provisioner
    # will set default as `ext4`. Note that `xfs` is not recommended due to potential deadlock
    # in hyperconverged settings where the volume is mounted on the same node as the osds.
    csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: ext4
reclaimPolicy: Delete

# Optional, if you want to add dynamic resize for PVC.
# For now only ext3, ext4, xfs resize support provided, like in Kubernetes itself.
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

## NFS Server

The following yaml will provision the Ceph NFS gateway, which will allow you to
mount anything in CephFS via NFS. This is exceptionally useful for
troubleshooting deployments, as it's much easier to port forward, does not
require authentication (except IP address-based access controls), and doesn't
require any special drivers.

```yaml
# kubectl apply -f <file>
---
apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephNFS
metadata:
  name: nfs-server
  namespace: rook-ceph
spec:
  server:
    active: 1
```

Please keep in mind that the usual NFS limitations apply. NFS is ***NOT*** a
POSIX-compliant filesystem, and if your use case requires POSIX compliance,
you're going to have a bad time. This is simply a means of accessing your PVCs
as ordinary document stores. File locks may not be respected, and I/O will fail
if a file is deleted (this *sounds* like intuitive behavior, but actually is
not how most filesystems work, and can cause real problems in production).

You'll also need a service to access this NFS server. Here is an example:

```yaml
# kubectl apply -f <file>
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nfs-server
  namespace: rook-ceph
spec:
  ports:
    - name: nfs
      port: 2049
  type: LoadBalancer
  loadBalancerIP: <redacted> # Set this to your IP address
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  selector:
    # Use the name of the CephNFS here
    ceph_nfs: nfs-server

    # It is safest to send clients to a single NFS server instance. Instance "a" always exists.
    # ^-- Please pay attention to this!!!
    #     NFS can get weird in high availability deployments!!!
    #     I'm tired of cleaning up messes caused by poor NFS deployments...
    instance: a
```

Note that if you're following this guide in order, This service won't work just
yet. We will set up a load balancer in the next section.
